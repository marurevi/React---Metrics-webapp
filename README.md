# React - Metrics Webapp

> This React capstone project (remember what are they?)is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that you will create making use of React and Redux.

>You will select an API that provides numeric data about a topic that you like and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have several pages:

> - one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters; in the example below, it's a list of metrics that can be filtered by the country (imagine a search field to introduce the country name like Italy, Croatia, etc.). This page should be your homepage.
> - one page for the item details; in the example, the detail page for Czech Republic cities with number of views.
